#### NTRODUCTION TO A-FRAME

# Review
Woohoo! In this lesson, you learned how to create an A-Frame box primitive and change its attributes.

For review:

- A-Frame can be added by using:

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js"></script>

```

- A-Frame code is contained inside an <a-scene> element that establishes the scene with the following primitives:
  - <a-box>
  - <a-sphere>
  - <a-cylinder>
  - <a-plane>
  - <a-sky>
- Each of the primitives can be transformed with the following components:
  - color
  - position
  - rotation
  - scale

With these tools, we now have the power to create the building blocks of our VR scene.

To learn more about primitives, visit the [A-Frame](./https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/html-and-primitives.html) documentation.
